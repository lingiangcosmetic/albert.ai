Examples of affinity audience segments include Frequently Eats Breakfast Out, Sports Game Fans and Thrill Seekers. By targeting all relevant affinity audiences and continuously analyzing performance, Albert recommended shifting ad budgets as ad performance changed. The combination of starting broad and continuous optimization resulted in an improved campaign ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyzing tens of affinity audience segments to uncover ad performance shifts as they happen according to product SKU and location is only possible by using AI technology. When Albert detects a shift in performance, ad spend is shifted instantly to the affinity audiences performing better, resulting in a better marketer ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second optimization tactic that was effective for this CPG marketer was retargeting. The re-engagement of users who had previously clicked on and engaged with an ad from said marketer was a targeting segment that delivered a strong ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, like most marketers, this CPG marketer is asking users to provide first-party data, which users provide as part of the value exchange for the benefits of customer loyalty programs. The use of first-party data in conjunction with Albert was highly effective, further improving campaign ROI for this CPG marketer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><\/p>\n<cite>\u201cThe privacy changes that the ad industry is going through do not mean that audience targeting is dead.
