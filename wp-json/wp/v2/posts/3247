Therefore, they tend to think that, just like AI-based robots have replaced employees in large logistical facilities, they\u2019ll replace content writers, programmers, designers and marketers,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sagi-weinberg-054a4123\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sagi Weinberg<\/a>, Albert\u2019s Sales Director.&nbsp;Sagi, a long-time digital marketer with background in Sales, has vast experience in leading brands to great success. Sagi is highly experienced in planning and executing holistic marketing strategies aimed to drive measurable and sustainable bottom line results by identifying the business\u2019 structure and needs, considering online and backend flows, creating a healthy marketing mix, devising a full funnel, channel-customized approach and implementing the right technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the latest talk about AI, many online publications are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02\">capitalizing<\/a> on this trend, as amplifying fears means amplifying clicks. Before we know it, a range of professions seems to be on the edge of extinction. But for marketers, at least, it\u2019s not the end of the story. As the following interview clarifies, AI won\u2019t replace marketers.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"515\" height=\"293\" src=\"https:\/\/albert.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/albert-blog-featured-image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/albert.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/albert-blog-featured-image.png 515w, https:\/\/albert.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/albert-blog-featured-image-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why AI Makes Marketers More Valuable<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s true, Sagi says &#8211; \u201chumans have inherited limitations. They take vacations, take weekends off, get sick and need to sleep. A machine doesn\u2019t. It also doesn\u2019t tire or get confused by processing amounts of data humans simply aren\u2019t able to.\u201d So again, marketers\u2019 fears are understandable. But \u201cthat\u2019s exactly where humans can capitalize and <a href=\"https:\/\/albert.ai\/blog\/6-advertiser-blind-spots-we-must-overcome-in-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use machines to enhance their capabilities<\/a>,\u201d Sagi says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set the Foundation for More Efficient Campaigns<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAI helps you connect the dots between online and offline marketing efforts,\u201d and between top and bottom of the funnel, Sagi says. \u201cIt closes the loop on the whole funnel,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, he explains, marketers can focus on a coherent, unified strategy that leads to better growth, more efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simplify and Deepen Market Research<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026 and do so at a greater speed, Sagi says. AI can find low hanging fruit audiences that us humans never would have considered, like Americans buying gifts for an Australian holiday because they have loved ones in Oz. It can also let you know how to communicate better with your existing, but lower performing audiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Test A Wide Range of Creative Assets<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s only so much campaign managers can do manually on a daily or weekly basis, but there\u2019s no limit for what AI can do. In our platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/albert.ai\/ai-marketing-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Albert<\/a>, for example, you can automatically test a wide range of copy-visual combinations to quickly find the best fit for each audience segment. It actually does it for you, without the need to set anything up. With one time setting and uploading of assets, Albert creates new creative sets for either search or social platforms, knowing the limitation of each platform (creative wise).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free Up Your Creativity<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though AI takes the mixing and matching of creative assets, humans are still the ones creating the assets. In addition, according to Sagi, when AI does the heavy lifting on time consuming activities, such as massive testing and data analysis, marketers have more availability to delve into and express their creativity &#8211; not just in copy or design, but in strategy, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Joe Hart, president and CEO at Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/why-creativity-top-business-skill-post-covid-workplace-joe-hart\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reports<\/a>, \u201ccreative companies are 1.5 times more likely to command a greater market share\u201d and 67% of \u201cthe most creative companies\u2026 had above-average organic revenue growth.\u201d Meaning, AI won\u2019t replace marketers because companies need the marketers that combine forces with AI tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make the Most of Your Budget<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi says that, with AI, \u201cyou can manage budgets in an unbiased, efficient manner. AI tools don\u2019t have a platform preference. They can look at your whole activity from a bird\u2019s eye view, and automatically shift budgets within the channel and across channels, toward the best performing activities.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimize 24\/7<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCampaign managers, and CMOs use tools like Albert to perform optimizations 24\/7, even when they sleep,\u201d Sagi says. \u201cAI can analyze huge volumes of data at any given moment. Tools like Albert are capable of simultaneously analyzing stats of multiple ads, across multiple campaigns in various platforms, and across different channels,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlus, rather than looking at last month\u2019s best performing ad, keyword or audience, which us humans usually do, AI can do it live, while also exploring new audiences,\u201d he says. \u201cIt uses one set of logics that make all the decisions unified and persistent, without compromising KPIs,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it keeps you in the loop. Albert, for example, \u201cplugs into your ad account, manages the activity and later shows the number of calculations that were made, the amount of actions that were taken, the best performing ad variations and geographies. It breaks down the most relevant audiences and provides in-depth insight on every step of the marketing funnel in every channel respectively, as well as the whole paid media activity holistically, to help marketers make the right decisions in terms of brand-level creatives, localizing creatives for specific markets, and all the way down to adding keywords they could never have discovered otherwise to a landing page,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before AI, \u201chumans could only dream of such efficiency,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How AI Helps Marketers Prove Their Value to the C-Suite<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a late 2022 LinkedIn and YouGov survey <a href=\"https:\/\/news.linkedin.com\/2022\/november\/helping-marketers-prove-their-strategy-is-working\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed<\/a>, \u201c77% of CMOs globally feel under pressure to prove greater short-term ROI on their marketing campaigns.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi agrees. He thinks that, not only AI won\u2019t replace marketers &#8211; but it will also help them keep their jobs and thrive professionally. \u201cA clear view of results is essential for decision makers,\u201d he says. Thankfully, \u201cthere are many ways to test the efficiencies of humans vs. machines. Efficiencies can be measured on many levels, including saved time, growth and other success metric improvement,\u201d he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even measure the machine\u2019s success directly vs. your best PPC marketers. But be aware &#8211; every time we did this here at Albert, the machine won. So be prepared to share that alongside the achievements your human team accomplished thanks to more time, better data processing and deeper audience targeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI Won\u2019t Replace Marketers Because AI Needs Marketers to Succeed<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Sagi\u2019s insights, today\u2019s popular AI tools are great for amplifying marketing, but marketing management still requires the human element. Marketers are still needed &#8211; and will be needed for a while &#8211; to develop and manage the vision, goals and business model. They need to decide how they measure KPIs, and take all the above into account, in addition to the company\u2019s limitations, when reviewing actionable analytics and deciding on next steps, he explains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it\u2019s marketers who \u201cdecide on appropriate budgets, determine dates for time-sensitive or seasonality related promotions, etc. Those are strategy level decisions humans will always be necessary for,\u201d he adds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there\u2019s more. Marketers are the ones who understand their brands best &#8211; on top of industry regulation, sensitivities and brand safety. \u201cThey need to make sure they adhere to those requirements,\u201d he clarifies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is how Albert was designed,\u201d he says, <a href=\"https:\/\/albert.ai\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">inviting you to get in touch for a free demo with his team<\/a>. \u201cIt was designed to work hand-in-hand with humans. Humans are the ones who set the guardrails, define guidelines, and have a confined framework configured to the AI to work within,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s your brand, and you\u2019re still its leader.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An interview with Sagi Weinberg, Sales Director at Albert We completely understand why people fear the recent uprising technology. \u201cAs ChatGPT, MidJourney and other AI tools gain popularity, people hear about their phenomenal capabilities, yet aren\u2019t familiar with these technologies.
