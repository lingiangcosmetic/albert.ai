There are some tasks that only humans can do, so outsourcing the rest to machines helps us do them better. But what makes a great collaboration? You know, the kind that generates significant results, that make advertisers the new stars of their companies?<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">To find out, we talked to our very own Product Solutions Manager, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nir-huberman-23a0a45\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nir Huberman<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Nir has been in the industry for about a decade and a half. At Albert alone, he spent the past 12 years climbing his way up from head of optimization to head of product and, then, to VP of product solutions, so he has tons of behind the scenes knowledge. Here are his top requirements for machine-advertiser collaborations that will increase your bottom line in 2023.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) Create a Holistic, Omnichannel Marketing Operation<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If your marketing departments work in silos, you\u2019re not alone. Too often, companies separate teams per channels, platforms or strategies. They have different departments for Google, TikTok, direct marketing, digital marketing &#8211; you name it. It\u2019s understandable, as every part of marketing requires its own specialization. But no channel or platform exists on its own.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What you do on one platform impacts how customers experience your brand elsewhere, online or off. Just as importantly, the data you generate on one platform can help you optimize results everywhere else you operate.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Therefore, after working with leading brands from across the world, Nir suggests unifying your entire marketing operations. This is especially useful when working with machines. You already have a machine that can process lots of data, plan and execute a complex strategy\u2026 You might as well make the most of it and let it optimize your entire marketing results across channels.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2) Combine Paid with Organic<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nir recommends taking your holistic marketing collaboration even further by combining paid with organic into one plan.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u201cAs a strategic business, you want to use your paid efforts to empower your organic efforts &#8211; brand awareness, direct communications, loyalty programs, email, etc,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you strengthen your customer base, you create a business that\u2019s objectively healthier,\u201d he explains.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3) Plan Way Ahead<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u201cIf I give my machine a $100,000 budget in November and don\u2019t tell it there\u2019s this thing called Black Friday, it\u2019ll likely blow the entire budget before Black Friday.

If I change things a week later, I lose everything the machine has learned and need to start training it from scratch,\u201d he says.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">5) Conduct Ongoing Monitoring<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another key requirement when choosing and working with AdTech is your ability to monitor its activity and impact how it will move forward. \u201cDon\u2019t just set it and forget it, or come back a month later,\u201d Nir says.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sure, your advertising machine relieves a lot of your previous duties, but your help is still needed. \u201cLook at how your campaign is going at a high level, and if something looks off, talk about it with your account manager or make changes in the software. Maybe you need a specific integration, for example. Either way, without your feedback, it\u2019s hard for the machine or its providers to help you, because there are things only you and your team know,\u201d Nir says.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">6) Choose Great Tools<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nir stretches the significance of choosing tools that actually support your goals. Once you figure out your long term and short term KPIs &#8211; remember to be specific and consistent &#8211; make a list of everything you want to accomplish with the type of tool you\u2019re looking to add to your toolbox.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u201cThere are many tools that help you run campaigns. Usually, they recommend what\u2019s best to do, or you set a test and use the tool to better understand your audience. We built Albert to both plan and execute campaigns.

There are many driving aids, but there isn\u2019t a car where you get in, tell it to take you to the office, and that\u2019s it. You still have control over the car. You can still make changes. But you need to trust the car to take you where you need to go. Yet people are scared. And it\u2019s hard for them to let go of control in campaigns too. For some, there\u2019s a big fear to let go of a large media budget. For others, they think they can drive the campaign better than other humans or machines,\u201d Nir says.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u201cWe see this with Albert. Sometimes, people don\u2019t give it enough creative materials to allow it to efficiently optimize, or give it too many restrictions,\u201d he says. Again, it\u2019s important to stay on top of what your machine is doing, to monitor it, give feedback and make adjustments when necessary. You\u2019re in charge of teaching it how to serve your campaigns best. But simultaneously, you\u2019ve got to let go and let it do its thing if you want it to thrive.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Is There Really a Robot You Can Trust to Combine Departments, Plan Ahead, Execute Campaigns, Optimize as it Goes and Leave You with Full Control?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yep.
