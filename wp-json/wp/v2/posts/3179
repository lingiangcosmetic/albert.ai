While it\u2019s easy to compare the performance of two distinctly different ads, optimizing creative performance to determine the optimal size and color of the font for the ad\u2019s headline and other subjective creative elements is difficult for people because of our inherent biases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA creative director who has succeeded with bold headlines or has a preference for certain colors and color combinations will bring these biases to the ad creation and optimization process,\u201d said&nbsp;Nir Huberman, VP Product at&nbsp;Albert AI, part of the Zoomd marketing and publisher platform. \u201cBut Albert is more methodical, breaking down each potential parameter that impacts performance, testing each one by one. That\u2019s why Albert\u2019s technology can improve creative performance by optimizing ad parameters from among the options provided which enables exceeding client KPIs. Albert also provides a lot of value for marketers by knowing when to refresh or replace an ad\u2019s creative.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by determining which ad creative performed best using Albert, marketers are in a better position to create new ads that will perform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An e-commerce company contracted to work with&nbsp;Albert AI&nbsp;with the stated KPI of increasing Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) by 500%, a KPI that Albert\u2019s team believed was realistic. A few months after the conclusion of the onboarding process, Albert achieved an 800% improvement in ROAS. And in subsequent years, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.martechcube.com\/commerce-sales\/ecommerce\/\">e-commerce<\/a>&nbsp;company, now in its fourth year working with Albert, is still achieving improvements in ROAS that are between 10-20%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this e-commerce company, Albert was able to optimize ad creative by creating the best-performing ads for each target segment and each ad platform\/channel. Albert\u2019s technology creates the optimal ad by selecting the best images, colors, fonts, and texts that will generate the most cost-effective performance for the target audience. Finally, Albert\u2019s technology was able to efficiently determine when to refresh and then change ads to ensure optimal ROAS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Albert is an advertiser and an agency\u2019s autonomous marketing ally.
